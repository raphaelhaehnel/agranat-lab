# Project description

<p>
  This program is a tool to analyze microscope images. <br />
  
  The program is able to take an image of a crystal than contains a bragg grating,
  and computes the period of this grating. It uses the OpenCV library to proccess the image.

# Parameters

Two parameters have to be define: the <b>scale</b> and the <b>rotation angle</b><br />
<ul>
  <li>Scale: Define the length in micrometers for a single pixel</li>
  <li>Rotation angle: The angle for which we must rotate the image to make the lines of the grating parallel to the image borders</li>
</ul><br />
